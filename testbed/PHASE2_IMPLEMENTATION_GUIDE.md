---

## üêç PANDAS AGGREGATION CODE (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Step 1: Load Play-by-Play Data
```python
import nfl_data_py as nfl
import pandas as pd

# Load PBP for seasons 2022-2024
pbp = nfl.import_pbp_data(years=[2022, 2023, 2024])
print(f"Loaded {len(pbp):,} play-by-play records")

# Filter to offensive plays only (has posteam)
grp = pbp[pbp.posteam.notna()].copy()
```

---

### Step 2: Create Helper Columns
```python
# Separate pass/rush yards for easier aggregation
grp["rush_yards"] = grp["yards_gained"].where(grp["rush_attempt"] == 1, 0)
grp["pass_yards"] = grp["yards_gained"].where(grp["pass_attempt"] == 1, 0)
```

---

### Step 3: Aggregate to Team-Game Level
```python
team_game = (
    grp.groupby(["game_id", "season", "week", "posteam"], dropna=False)
    .agg(
        plays=("play_id", "count"),
        yards_total=("yards_gained", "sum"),
        yards_pass=("pass_yards", "sum"),
        yards_rush=("rush_yards", "sum"),
        pass_attempts=("pass_attempt", "sum"),
        rush_attempts=("rush_attempt", "sum"),
        sacks=("sack", "sum"),
        interceptions=("interception", "sum"),
        fumbles_lost=("fumble_lost", "sum"),
        success_plays=("success", "sum"),
        epa_total=("epa", "sum"),
        epa_per_play=("epa", "mean"),  # Alternative: sum/plays
    )
    .reset_index()
    .rename(columns={"posteam": "team_id"})
)
```

---

### Step 4: Calculate Derived Fields
```python
# Efficiency metrics
team_game["success_rate"] = team_game["success_plays"] / team_game["plays"].clip(lower=1)
team_game["yards_per_play"] = team_game["yards_total"] / team_game["plays"].clip(lower=1)
team_game["turnovers"] = team_game["interceptions"] + team_game["fumbles_lost"]
```

---

### Step 5: Add Points & Opponent
```python
# Get scores and opponent from PBP
scores = (
    pbp.groupby(["game_id", "season", "week", "posteam", "defteam"], dropna=False)
    .agg(pf=("posteam_score", "max"), pa=("defteam_score", "max"))
    .reset_index()
    .rename(columns={"posteam": "team_id", "defteam": "opponent_id"})
)

# Merge scores into team_game
team_game = team_game.merge(
    scores[["game_id", "team_id", "opponent_id", "pf", "pa"]],
    on=["game_id", "team_id"],
    how="left"
)
team_game = team_game.rename(columns={"pf": "points_for", "pa": "points_against"})
```

---

### Step 6: Pass/Rush EPA per Play
```python
# Rush EPA per play
rush = (
    grp[grp["rush_attempt"] == 1]
    .groupby(["game_id", "posteam"])
    .epa.mean()
    .reset_index()
    .rename(columns={"posteam": "team_id", "epa": "rush_epa_per_play"})
)

# Pass EPA per play
pas = (
    grp[grp["pass_attempt"] == 1]
    .groupby(["game_id", "posteam"])
    .epa.mean()
    .reset_index()
    .rename(columns={"posteam": "team_id", "epa": "pass_epa_per_play"})
)

# Merge EPA splits
team_game = (
    team_game
    .merge(rush, on=["game_id", "team_id"], how="left")
    .merge(pas, on=["game_id", "team_id"], how="left")
)
```

---

### Step 7: Situational Stats (3rd/4th Down & Red Zone)
```python
# 3rd down stats
third_down = (
    grp[grp["down"] == 3]
    .groupby(["game_id", "posteam"])
    .agg(
        third_down_att=("play_id", "count"),
        third_down_conv=("third_down_converted", "sum")
    )
    .reset_index()
    .rename(columns={"posteam": "team_id"})
)

# 4th down stats
fourth_down = (
    grp[grp["down"] == 4]
    .groupby(["game_id", "posteam"])
    .agg(
        fourth_down_att=("play_id", "count"),
        fourth_down_conv=("fourth_down_converted", "sum")
    )
    .reset_index()
    .rename(columns={"posteam": "team_id"})
)

# Red zone trips (drives with any snap inside 20)
red_zone = (
    grp[grp["yardline_100"] <= 20]
    .groupby(["game_id", "posteam"])
    .agg(
        red_zone_trips=("fixed_drive", "nunique"),
        red_zone_tds=("touchdown", "sum")
    )
    .reset_index()
    .rename(columns={"posteam": "team_id"})
)
red_zone["red_zone_td_rate"] = red_zone["red_zone_tds"] / red_zone["red_zone_trips"].clip(lower=1)

# Merge situational stats
team_game = (
    team_game
    .merge(third_down, on=["game_id", "team_id"], how="left")
    .merge(fourth_down, on=["game_id", "team_id"], how="left")
    .merge(red_zone, on=["game_id", "team_id"], how="left")
)

# Fill NaN with 0 for teams with no attempts
team_game[["third_down_att", "third_down_conv", "fourth_down_att", "fourth_down_conv"]] = \
    team_game[["third_down_att", "third_down_conv", "fourth_down_att", "fourth_down_conv"]].fillna(0)
```

---

### Step 8: Add Context from Schedules
```python
# Load schedules for home/away and rest days
schedules = nfl.import_schedules(years=[2022, 2023, 2024])

# Create home context for home team
home_context = schedules[["game_id", "home_team", "home_rest", "gameday"]].copy()
home_context["is_home"] = True
home_context = home_context.rename(columns={
    "home_team": "team_id",
    "home_rest": "days_rest",
    "gameday": "game_date"
})

# Create away context for away team
away_context = schedules[["game_id", "away_team", "away_rest", "gameday"]].copy()
away_context["is_home"] = False
away_context = away_context.rename(columns={
    "away_team": "team_id",
    "away_rest": "days_rest",
    "gameday": "game_date"
})

# Combine and merge
context = pd.concat([home_context, away_context])
team_game = team_game.merge(context, on=["game_id", "team_id"], how="left")

# Derive short_week and off_bye
team_game["short_week"] = team_game["days_rest"] < 6
team_game["off_bye"] = team_game["days_rest"] >= 13
team_game["home_field"] = team_game["is_home"]  # Alias for clarity
```

---

### Step 9: Rolling Averages (Momentum)
```python
# Sort by team and date
team_game = team_game.sort_values(["team_id", "season", "week"])

# Calculate rolling averages (last 3 and 5 games)
team_game["epa_l3"] = team_game.groupby("team_id")["epa_per_play"].transform(
    lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean()
)
team_game["epa_l5"] = team_game.groupby("team_id")["epa_per_play"].transform(
    lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(window=5, min_periods=1).mean()
)
team_game["ppg_for_l3"] = team_game.groupby("team_id")["points_for"].transform(
    lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean()
)
team_game["ppg_against_l3"] = team_game.groupby("team_id")["points_against"].transform(
    lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean()
)
team_game["ypp_l3"] = team_game.groupby("team_id")["yards_per_play"].transform(
    lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean()
)
team_game["sr_l3"] = team_game.groupby("team_id")["success_rate"].transform(
    lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean()
)

# Note: .shift(1) prevents look-ahead bias - only uses PRIOR games
```

## üìÇ FILE STRUCTURE

```
testbed/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (this file)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nflverse_data_loader.py (to create)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_aggregation.py (test pandas code)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ phase2_schema.sql (database creation script)
```

---

## ‚úÖ NEXT STEPS

1. **Create `nflverse_data_loader.py`** with all pandas aggregation code
2. **Create `phase2_schema.sql`** with PostgreSQL table definition
3. **Test aggregation** on 2024 Week 1 only (validate output)
4. **Load full dataset** (2022-2024 = ~850 games)
5. **Verify data quality** (check for NaN, outliers, missing games)
6. **Create API endpoints** for historical queries
7. **Build simple UI** to display team stats

---

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

### **Field Availability by Year:**
- `third_down_converted` / `fourth_down_converted` may be missing in older years
- Derive from `first_down` gained and `ydstogo` if flags missing
- `success` flag introduced in 2016+ seasons
- `epa` available 1999+ (from nflfastR model)

### **Performance Warnings:**
- Play-by-play is **LARGE** (~45-50k plays/season)
- 3 seasons = ~150k plays to aggregate
- Use `.clip(lower=1)` to prevent division by zero
- Cache aggregated results - don't re-process PBP every API call

### **Data Quality:**
- Check for games with `plays == 0` (data errors)
- Verify `points_for` matches actual game scores
- Ensure rolling averages don't leak future data (use `.shift(1)`)
- Handle NaN in rolling averages for first few games of season
