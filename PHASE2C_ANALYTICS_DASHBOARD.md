### Custom Builder Enhancement:
- Actually fetch and display selected stats (currently shows "Coming Soon")

- Injury impact analysis
- Historical trend visualizations (charts/graphs)

### User Features:
- Save favorite stat combinations
- Email alerts for betting opportunities
- Portfolio tracking (bet history)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor:
1. React Hook warnings (useEffect dependencies) - cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality
2. Custom Builder displays "Coming Soon" - planned for future enhancement
3. No data persistence for user preferences

### Resolved:
- ✅ Team dropdown not showing text → Fixed with black text on white background
- ✅ Legends not visible → Added and styled properly
- ✅ Analytics route missing → Integrated into App.js and SideMenu

2. **Color Contrast Matters:** White text on transparent backgrounds was invisible - fixed with opaque backgrounds
3. **Modular Design:** 6 separate tabs keep the UI organized and not overwhelming
4. **API Architecture:** Feature engineering views in database make frontend queries simple and fast
5. **React Build Process:** Must rebuild after CSS/JS changes for production deployment
