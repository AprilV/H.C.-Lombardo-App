## 🎯 Cleanup Impact Assessment

### Files Removed (7 total):
1. data_refresh_scheduler.py (168 lines)
2. schedule library (Python package)
3. testbed/production_system/health_check.py
4. testbed/production_system/shutdown.py
5. testbed/production_system/startup.py
6. testbed/production_system/live_data_updater.py
7. testbed/production_system/README.md + TEST_RESULTS.md

### Production Impact:
**NONE** - All production functionality retained and verified working.

### What Still Works:
✅ Database connectivity (32 teams, 11 columns)  
✅ API server startup and endpoints  
✅ Data fetching from ESPN + TeamRankings  
✅ Data updates with timestamps  
✅ Live data updater (single + continuous modes)  
✅ API verification testing  
✅ All CORS and frontend integration  

### What Was Actually Removed:
❌ Duplicate refresh scheduler (use `live_data_updater.py --continuous` instead)  
❌ Unnecessary schedule library dependency  
❌ Duplicate copies of production files in testbed/

## 🚀 How To Use After Cleanup

### Start System:
```bash
# Start API server
python api_server.py

# In another terminal, start continuous updates (every 15 min)
python live_data_updater.py --continuous

# OR custom interval (every 10 min)
python live_data_updater.py --continuous 10
```

### Manual Data Update:
```bash
# One-time update
python live_data_updater.py

# OR directly
python multi_source_data_fetcher.py
```

### Test API:
```bash
# Run verification tests
python verify_api.py
```
