# APRIL'S DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES CHECKLIST
**Always Follow These Rules - No Exceptions!**

---

## 🧪 TESTBED FIRST (Non-Negotiable)
- [ ] **NEVER** write code directly in production
- [ ] **ALWAYS** create/use testbed environment first
- [ ] All new features go to `testbed/prototypes/[feature_name]/`
- [ ] Test until 100% pass rate achieved
- [ ] Only then move to production

**Example Path:**
```
testbed/prototypes/port_management/  ← Test here first
          ↓ (100% pass rate)
Production files  ← Only after validation
```

---

## ✅ TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] **100% test pass rate** required before production
- [ ] Unit tests created for all components
- [ ] Integration tests verify full workflow
- [ ] Database connectivity verified
- [ ] All API endpoints tested
- [ ] Error handling validated

**April's Rule:** "If tests don't pass 100%, we're not done."

---

## 💾 BACKUP BEFORE CHANGES
- [ ] Create timestamped backup before ANY production change
- [ ] Store in `backups/` directory
- [ ] Format: `[filename]_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.py`
- [ ] Verify backup was created successfully

**Command Template:**
```powershell
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss'
Copy-Item [file].py "backups\[file]_backup_$timestamp.py"
```

---

## 🔄 ROLLBACK PROCEDURES READY
- [ ] Know the rollback command before deploying
- [ ] Have original stable version available
- [ ] Document rollback criteria
- [ ] Test rollback procedure

**Quick Rollback:**
```powershell
Stop-Process -Name python* -Force
python api_server.py  # Original stable version
```

---

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION
- [ ] Update dr.foster.md with changes
- [ ] Document what was changed and why
- [ ] Include test results
- [ ] Add rollback procedures
- [ ] Use April's name (not "student")

---

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

```
Step 1: TESTBED
  └─ Create feature in testbed/
  └─ Write tests
  └─ Run tests until 100% pass
  └─ Document results

Step 2: BACKUP
  └─ Create timestamped backup
  └─ Verify backup exists

Step 3: DEPLOY
  └─ Stop production
  └─ Deploy new version
  └─ Verify deployment

Step 4: VERIFY
  └─ Run verification tests
  └─ Check logs
  └─ Monitor for 5 minutes

Step 5: ROLLBACK (if needed)
  └─ Stop new version
  └─ Restore backup or stable version
  └─ Return to testbed
```

---

## 🚫 NEVER DO THESE

❌ Deploy without testing in testbed  
❌ Accept less than 100% test pass rate  
❌ Make production changes without backup  
❌ Skip documentation  
❌ Assume it works without verification  
❌ Leave production broken while debugging  
❌ Hard-code values that should be configurable  
❌ Commit without testing first  
❌ Use "student" instead of "April"  
❌ Skip error handling  
❌ Ignore warnings or errors in logs  
❌ Deploy on Friday afternoon (Murphy's Law!)  
❌ Make changes directly in production terminal  
❌ Forget to verify database connections  
❌ Leave debug print statements in production code  
❌ Keep commented-out code (use Git instead)  
❌ Have duplicate files scattered around  
❌ Mix concerns in one file (database + API + frontend)  
❌ Use unclear variable names like `x`, `temp`, `data1`  
❌ Keep unused imports

1. Assess severity
2. Monitor or rollback based on decision matrix
3. Document behavior
4. Fix in testbed
5. Re-deploy only after 100% pass

---

## 🤖 AI ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS

**When April asks you to do something, ALWAYS:**

1. Ask: "Should we do this in testbed first?"
2. Create tests before implementation
3. Run tests and show results
4. Ask: "Ready to deploy to production with backup?"
5. Create backup before production changes
6. Verify after deployment
7. Update documentation

**Default Response Template:**
```
"April, I'll implement this in the testbed first:
1. Creating testbed/prototypes/[feature]/
2. Writing tests for [feature]
3. Implementing [feature]
4. Running tests
5. Only moving to production after 100% pass

Does this approach work for you?"
```

---

## 🔧 ADDITIONAL BEST PRACTICES

### Port Management
- [ ] Always check which ports are in use before starting services
- [ ] Use PortManager for automatic port allocation
- [ ] Document which service uses which port
- [ ] Stop services cleanly (don't force kill unless necessary)

**Commands:**
```powershell
# Check ports in use
netstat -ano | findstr ":5000 :3000 :8000"

# Stop Python processes cleanly
Stop-Process -Name python* -Force  # Only when necessary
```

### Database Best Practices
- [ ] Test database connection before queries
- [ ] Use environment variables for credentials (never hard-code)
- [ ] Always close connections when done
- [ ] Use transactions for data integrity
- [ ] Verify data after inserts/updates

**Example:**
```python
# Always verify connection first
conn = get_db_connection()
if not conn:
    print("ERROR: Database not available")
    return False
```

### Git Workflow
- [ ] Commit working code only (all tests passing)
- [ ] Write clear commit messages
- [ ] Pull before push
- [ ] Don't force push unless necessary
- [ ] Keep commits focused on one feature/fix

**Good Commit Messages:**
```
✅ "Added port management with 100% test coverage"
✅ "Fixed socket binding test for Windows compatibility"
✅ "Updated documentation with deployment procedures"
❌ "Updated files"
❌ "Changes"
```

### Error Handling
- [ ] Every function that can fail should have try/except
- [ ] Log errors with context (what was being attempted)
- [ ] Provide user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Don't silently fail - always inform the user
- [ ] Include traceback in logs for debugging

**Template:**
```python
try:
    # Your code here
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed during [operation]: {str(e)}")
    return {"error": "User-friendly message", "status": "failed"}
```

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Use config files, not hard-coded values
- [ ] Environment-specific configs (dev, test, production)
- [ ] Document all configuration options
- [ ] Provide sensible defaults
- [ ] Never commit secrets or passwords

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Configurable
PORT = config.get('API_PORT', 5000)

# Bad: Hard-coded
PORT = 5000  # What if 5000 is in use?
```

### Logging Best Practices
- [ ] Log important events (startup, shutdown, errors)
- [ ] Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- [ ] Include timestamps and context
- [ ] Don't log sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
- [ ] Review logs regularly

**Log Levels:**
```python
logger.debug("Detailed debug information")
logger.info("Server started on port 5000")
logger.warning("Port 5000 in use, trying 5001")
logger.error("Database connection failed")
```

### API Development
- [ ] Every endpoint needs error handling
- [ ] Return proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Include helpful error messages
- [ ] Test all endpoints before deployment
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Version your APIs (/api/v1/, /api/v2/)

**Status Codes:**
```
200: Success
201: Created
400: Bad request (client error)
404: Not found
500: Server error
```

### Frontend-Backend Integration
- [ ] Enable CORS properly for React frontend
- [ ] Use consistent data formats (JSON)
- [ ] Handle loading states in frontend
- [ ] Display user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Test the full stack together

### Performance
- [ ] Don't load all data at once (use pagination)
- [ ] Cache frequently-accessed data
- [ ] Close database connections promptly
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Optimize slow queries

### Security
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Use environment variables for secrets
- [ ] Don't expose internal error details to users
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production

### Code Quality
- [ ] Use meaningful variable names
- [ ] Write comments for complex logic
- [ ] Keep functions focused (single responsibility)
- [ ] Avoid code duplication (DRY principle)
- [ ] Format code consistently
- [ ] Remove unused imports
- [ ] Delete commented-out code (use Git history instead)
- [ ] Remove debug print statements before production
- [ ] Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
- [ ] Remove TODO comments after completing tasks

**Good vs Bad:**
```python
# Good: Clear and self-documenting
def calculate_team_win_percentage(wins, total_games):
    if total_games == 0:
        return 0.0
    return (wins / total_games) * 100

# Bad: Unclear
def calc(w, t):
    return (w/t)*100 if t else 0
```

### File Organization
- [ ] Keep related files together in directories
- [ ] Use clear, descriptive filenames
- [ ] Separate concerns (database, API, frontend)
- [ ] Remove duplicate files
- [ ] Archive old/unused files (don't delete, move to archive/)
- [ ] Keep production files separate from testbed
- [ ] One purpose per file (don't mix database + API in same file)

**Good Structure:**
```
H.C Lombardo App/
├── api_server.py          # API endpoints only
├── db_config.py           # Database configuration
├── port_manager.py        # Port management
├── testbed/               # All testing
│   └── prototypes/        # Feature testing
├── frontend/              # React app
├── logs/                  # Log files
├── backups/               # Backup files
└── archive/               # Old versions
```

### Code Cleanup Checklist
- [ ] Remove unused variables
- [ ] Remove unused functions
- [ ] Remove commented-out code
- [ ] Remove debug print statements
- [ ] Fix all linting warnings
- [ ] Remove duplicate code
- [ ] Consolidate similar functions
- [ ] Update outdated comments
- [ ] Remove temporary test files
- [ ] Clean up import statements (remove unused, organize alphabetically)

**Before Production:**
```python
# Bad: Messy code
import os, sys, time, datetime, requests  # Unused imports
# from old_module import something  # Commented code
def process_data(data):
    print("DEBUG: data =", data)  # Debug statement
    # temp = data + 1  # Old code
    result = data * 2
    print("TESTING:", result)  # More debug
    return result
```

**After Cleanup:**
```python
# Good: Clean code
def process_data(data):
    """Process data by doubling the value."""
    return data * 2
```

### Refactoring Best Practices
- [ ] Refactor when you touch code (leave it better than you found it)
- [ ] Extract repeated code into functions
- [ ] Break large functions into smaller ones
- [ ] Use meaningful names when refactoring
- [ ] Test after each refactoring step
- [ ] Don't refactor and add features simultaneously

**Refactoring Steps:**
1. Write tests for existing behavior
2. Make small refactoring change
3. Run tests (should still pass)
4. Commit
5. Repeat

## 📁 PROJECT ORGANIZATION STANDARDS

### Directory Structure Rules
- [ ] `testbed/` - All testing and experiments
- [ ] `backups/` - Timestamped backups before production changes
- [ ] `archive/` - Old versions, deprecated files
- [ ] `logs/` - Application logs
- [ ] `frontend/` - React application only
- [ ] `docs/` or `*.md` files - Documentation
- [ ] Root directory - Active production files only

### File Naming Conventions
- [ ] Use lowercase with underscores: `api_server.py`
- [ ] Be descriptive: `test_port_manager.py` not `test1.py`
- [ ] Include version in backups: `api_server_backup_20251009_143000.py`
- [ ] Test files start with `test_`: `test_database.py`
- [ ] Config files end with `_config.py`: `db_config.py`

### When to Archive Files
- [ ] File hasn't been used in 30+ days
- [ ] Replaced by newer version
- [ ] Experimental code that didn't work out
- [ ] Duplicate functionality exists elsewhere
- [ ] Keep in archive/ directory with date: `archive/old_api_20251001.py`

**Archive Command:**
```powershell
# Move to archive with timestamp
$date = Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd'
Move-Item "old_file.py" "archive/old_file_$date.py"
```

### Code Cleanup Schedule
- [ ] **Daily:** Remove debug prints and temporary variables
- [ ] **Weekly:** Review and remove unused imports
- [ ] **Before each deployment:** Full cleanup checklist
- [ ] **Monthly:** Archive unused files, review project structure
- [ ] **After each feature:** Refactor and clean related code

## 📂 WORKSPACE ORGANIZATION (VS Code Explorer)

### The Problem:
- ❌ Important files buried in 20+ files in root directory
- ❌ Hard to find dr.foster.md or documentation
- ❌ Files not grouped by purpose
- ❌ Unmatched structure (frontend/ but no backend/)
- ❌ Tests mixed with production code

### The Solution: Logical Folder Structure

**Recommended Structure:**
```
Project Root/
├── 📄 KEY_DOCUMENT.md           ← Top-level important files
├── 📄 README.md                 ← Project overview
├── 📄 BEST_PRACTICES.md         ← Standards
├── 📄 .env                      ← Config (collapsible in VS Code)
│
├── 📁 backend/                  ← All backend code
│   ├── api_server.py
│   ├── db_config.py
│   └── ...
│
├── 📁 frontend/                 ← All frontend code
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   └── package.json
│
├── 📁 docs/                     ← All documentation
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md
│   ├── API_GUIDE.md
│   └── ...
│
├── 📁 tests/                    ← All test files
│   ├── test_api.py
│   ├── test_database.py
│   └── ...
│
├── 📁 utilities/                ← Helper scripts
│   ├── log_viewer.py
│   └── ...
│
├── 📁 logs/                     ← Application logs
├── 📁 testbed/                  ← Testing environment
└── 📁 backups/                  ← Backup files
```

### Workspace Organization Checklist:
- [ ] Important files (README, assignment docs) at top level
- [ ] Group related files in folders (backend/, docs/, tests/)
- [ ] Match structure (if frontend/, then backend/)
- [ ] Keep root directory clean (< 10 files)
- [ ] Use descriptive folder names
- [ ] Consistent naming: lowercase, underscores
- [ ] .env files collapsible (VS Code does this automatically)

### VS Code Explorer Best Practices:
- [ ] Pin frequently-used files (right-click → "Pin")
- [ ] Collapse large folders (.env, node_modules, __pycache__)
- [ ] Use workspace search (Ctrl+P) for quick file access
- [ ] Keep important docs at top level for easy discovery
- [ ] Group by function, not file type

### Before Reorganization:
```
Root Directory: 25 files (cluttered!)
- api_server.py
- test_api.py
- dr.foster.md         ← Buried!
- PORT_GUIDE.md
- test_db.py
- DEPLOYMENT.md
- app.py
... (18 more files)
```

### After Reorganization:
```
Root Directory: 4 files (clean!)
- dr.foster.md         ← Easy to find!
- README.md
- BEST_PRACTICES.md
- .env
+ 6 organized folders
```

### How to Reorganize Safely:
1. **Create reorganization plan** (document new structure)
2. **Create new folders** (backend/, docs/, tests/, utilities/)
3. **Test in testbed first** (copy structure, test imports)
4. **Move files systematically** (one folder at a time)
5. **Update imports** (fix any broken import statements)
6. **Test everything** (API, frontend, database connections)
7. **Commit changes** (clear commit message)
8. **Update documentation** (reflect new paths)

### PowerShell Commands for Reorganization:
```powershell
# Create new folder structure
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "backend", "docs", "tests", "utilities" -Force

# Move files to backend/
Move-Item "api_server.py", "db_config.py", "app.py" -Destination "backend\"

# Move documentation
Move-Item "*_GUIDE.md", "DEPLOYMENT.md" -Destination "docs\"

# Move tests
Move-Item "test_*.py" -Destination "tests\"

# Move utilities
Move-Item "log_viewer.py", "quick_logs.py" -Destination "utilities\"
```

### Critical: Test After Reorganizing
```python
# Test imports still work
from backend.api_server import app
from backend.db_config import get_connection

# Test paths
import os
print(os.path.exists('backend/api_server.py'))  # Should be True
```

---

### Code Quality
- [ ] Use meaningful variable names
- [ ] Write comments for complex logic
- [ ] Keep functions focused (single responsibility)
- [ ] Avoid code duplication (DRY principle)
- [ ] Format code consistently

**Good vs Bad:**
```python
# Good: Clear and self-documenting
def calculate_team_win_percentage(wins, total_games):
    if total_games == 0:
        return 0.0
    return (wins / total_games) * 100

# Bad: Unclear
def calc(w, t):
    return (w/t)*100 if t else 0
```

### Documentation Standards
- [ ] README.md for every major component
- [ ] Code comments for complex logic
- [ ] API documentation with examples
- [ ] Update docs when code changes
- [ ] Include troubleshooting sections

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for individual functions
- [ ] Integration tests for workflows
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] Database connection tests
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] Test both success and failure cases

**Test Coverage Goals:**
```
✅ 100%: Critical features (database, API, port management)
✅ 80%+: Standard features
✅ 50%+: Experimental features in testbed
```

### Time Management
- [ ] Don't deploy major changes before weekends
- [ ] Allow time for monitoring after deployment
- [ ] Schedule maintenance windows
- [ ] Have rollback time built into deployment plan

### Communication
- [ ] Document what you're changing and why
- [ ] Update dr.foster.md with innovations
- [ ] Keep track of what's in production vs testbed
- [ ] Note any known issues or limitations

## 🔧 AprilPMGR (April Port Manager)

**The April Port Management System for DHCP-Style Port Allocation**

### What is AprilPMGR?
AprilPMGR is April's custom port management system that treats ports like DHCP treats IP addresses - automatic allocation, conflict detection, and graceful failover.

### Core Concept
Instead of hardcoding ports, AprilPMGR:
- Automatically scans for available ports in a defined range
- Detects port conflicts before they crash your app
- Gracefully fails over to alternate ports
- Logs all port assignments for debugging
- Provides health check endpoints

### Port Ranges (Professional Standard)
```python
# AprilPMGR Port Allocation Strategy
FLASK_API_RANGE = range(5000, 5010)      # Flask backend services
REACT_DEV_RANGE = range(3000, 3010)      # React development servers
DATABASE_RANGE = range(5432, 5442)       # PostgreSQL instances
MONITORING_RANGE = range(8000, 8010)     # Health checks & monitoring
```

### Key Features
1. **Conflict Detection**: Scans ports before binding
2. **Auto-Failover**: Tries next available port automatically
3. **Health Checks**: Built-in `/health` endpoint
4. **Logging**: Detailed port assignment logs
5. **Graceful Shutdown**: Releases ports properly

### Implementation Example
```python
# port_manager.py (AprilPMGR Core)
import socket
from contextlib import closing

def check_port_available(port):
    """Check if port is available (like DHCP lease check)"""
    with closing(socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)) as sock:
        return sock.connect_ex(('localhost', port)) != 0

def get_available_port(port_range):
    """Get first available port in range (like DHCP allocation)"""
    for port in port_range:
        if check_port_available(port):
            print(f"✅ AprilPMGR: Allocated port {port}")
            return port
    raise RuntimeError("❌ AprilPMGR: No ports available in range")

# Usage in Flask app
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

# AprilPMGR allocates port dynamically
PORT = get_available_port(range(5000, 5010))
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=PORT)
```

### Why AprilPMGR?
Traditional approach: `app.run(port=5000)` → Crashes if port 5000 busy  
AprilPMGR approach: `app.run(port=get_available_port(...))` → Auto-finds open port ✅

### Benefits
- ✅ No more "Address already in use" errors
- ✅ Multiple instances can run simultaneously
- ✅ Professional production-ready approach
- ✅ Easy to scale (just expand port range)
- ✅ Built-in monitoring and health checks

### Best Practices with AprilPMGR
1. Always use port ranges, never single ports
2. Log every port allocation
3. Include health check endpoints
4. Document which services use which ranges
5. Monitor port usage in production

**April's Motto:** "Let the system manage the ports, so you can focus on the code!"
