# REORGANIZATION TESTBED
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Author:** April V  
**Purpose:** Test workspace reorganization before applying to production

## Goal:
Test moving files to new folder structure (backend/, docs/, tests/, utilities/) to ensure:
1. Imports still work
2. API still runs
3. Frontend can still connect
4. No broken paths

## Current Test:
Testing reorganization of H.C Lombardo App workspace structure

## Steps:
1. ✅ Create testbed directory
2. Create new folder structure
3. Copy files to new locations
4. Test imports
5. Test API server
6. If all works → Apply to production
7. If issues → Debug here first

## Test Results:
(To be filled in after testing)
