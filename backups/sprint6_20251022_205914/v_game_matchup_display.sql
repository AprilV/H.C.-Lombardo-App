-- =====================================================================
-- HC in Lombardo â€” Human-facing Game Matchup View (Regular Season Only)
-- One row per game with home/away stats side-by-side.
-- Requires: hcl.games, hcl.team_game_stats, hcl.team_context (optional), hcl.weather (optional)
-- Safe to re-run.
-- =====================================================================
-- 
-- Purpose: Display view for UI/API consumption
-- Output: One row per game with home vs away stats pivoted side-by-side
-- Features:
--   - Season-to-date averages (per-game stats)
--   - Last-3 game form (momentum indicators)
--   - Simple diffs (home minus away edges)
--   - No look-ahead bias (only uses prior games)
--   - Regular season only
--
-- Usage:
--   SELECT * FROM v_game_matchup_display WHERE season = 2024 AND week = 8;

-- =====================================================================
-- NOTES
-- =====================================================================
--
-- 1. NO LOOK-AHEAD BIAS:
--    - Season-to-date uses t.week < b.week (only prior games)
--    - Last-3 uses ORDER BY t.week DESC LIMIT 3 (prior games only)
--    - Week 1 games will have NULL for season-to-date (no prior data)
--
-- 2. NULL HANDLING:
--    - If team hasn't played, all averages return NULL
--    - UI can display "N/A" or hide stats for Week 1
--    - NULLIF() prevents division by zero
--
-- 3. REGULAR SEASON ONLY:
--    - WHERE COALESCE(g.is_postseason, FALSE) = FALSE
--    - Excludes playoff games from view
--
-- 4. PERFORMANCE:
--    - CTEs optimize repeated aggregations
--    - LATERAL joins for last-3 are efficient with proper indexes
--    - Index on (season, team_id, week) recommended
--
-- 5. UI CONSUMPTION:
--    - Perfect for React matchup cards
--    - All fields are pre-calculated (no client-side math)
--    - Diffs show home advantage at a glance
