# Sprint 12 — Detailed Task Breakdown
**Theme:** Diagnose & Restore  
**Dates:** April 6 – April 18, 2026  
**Approach:** Treat this as a NEW project. Assume everything is broken. Prove otherwise.  
**Output:** A completed Production Issue Log that drives all work in Sprints 13–16.

## RULE FOR THIS SPRINT
Do NOT fix anything unless it takes under 5 minutes and is blocking discovery.  
Document everything. Fix later.

## AREA 1 — EC2 / Backend Server

### 1.1 SSH Access
- [ ] Confirm SSH key is available locally
- [ ] SSH into EC2 (`ssh -i <key>.pem ec2-user@34.198.25.249`)
- [ ] Confirm you can connect without errors
- [ ] Log result → Issue Log

### 1.2 Service Status
- [ ] `systemctl status hc-lombardo.service`
- [ ] Is it active/running or failed/inactive?
- [ ] `journalctl -u hc-lombardo.service -n 200` — read last 200 log lines
- [ ] Look for: import errors, missing packages, port conflicts, DB connection failures
- [ ] `ps aux | grep python` — is Flask process actually running?
- [ ] `netstat -tlnp | grep 5000` — is port 5000 actually listening?
- [ ] Log all findings → Issue Log

### 1.3 EC2 Environment
- [ ] `df -h` — check disk space (full disk kills everything)
- [ ] `free -m` — check memory
- [ ] `python3 --version` — confirm Python version
- [ ] `pip3 list | grep -E "flask|xgboost|psycopg2|pandas|sklearn"` — confirm packages installed
- [ ] Check if `.env` file exists on EC2 with correct DB password
- [ ] Check if `backups/` or other large folders eating disk
- [ ] Log findings → Issue Log

### 1.4 Security Group / Firewall
- [ ] Confirm port 5000 is open in AWS Security Group (EC2 console)
- [ ] Confirm port 5432 is NOT open externally (PostgreSQL should be local only)
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:5000/health` from inside EC2 — does Flask respond locally?
- [ ] Log findings → Issue Log

---

## AREA 2 — Database (PostgreSQL)

### 2.1 Service Status
- [ ] `systemctl status postgresql` — is DB running?
- [ ] `psql -U postgres -c "\l"` — list databases, confirm `nfl_analytics` exists
- [ ] `psql -U postgres -d nfl_analytics -c "\dn"` — confirm `hcl` schema exists
- [ ] Log findings → Issue Log

### 2.2 Table Integrity
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hcl.games;` — expect ~7,263
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hcl.team_game_stats;` — expect ~14,398
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hcl.ml_predictions;`
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hcl.betting_lines;`
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.teams;` — expect 32
- [ ] `SELECT season, COUNT(*) FROM hcl.games GROUP BY season ORDER BY season;` — check season coverage
- [ ] `SELECT MAX(season) FROM hcl.games;` — what is the most recent season loaded?
- [ ] Log findings → Issue Log

### 2.3 Data Quality Spot Check
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hcl.team_game_stats WHERE epa_per_play IS NULL;` — check EPA population
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hcl.games WHERE home_score IS NULL;` — check for incomplete games
- [ ] Log findings → Issue Log

### 2.4 Views
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hcl.v_team_betting_performance;` — views intact?
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hcl.v_weather_impact_analysis;`
- [ ] Log findings → Issue Log

### 3.4 Live Scores
- [ ] `GET /api/live-scores` — ESPN response (will be empty/offseason but should not error)

### 3.5 CORS Check
- [ ] Open browser DevTools → Network tab → load production frontend → look for CORS errors

## AREA 4 — Frontend / AWS Amplify

### 4.2 Page-by-Page Audit
Open the production URL in browser. Visit every page. For each:  
Record: Loads / Blank / Error / Partial

- [ ] **Homepage** — loads? data displays?
- [ ] **Live Scores** (`/live-scores`) — loads? (offseason = no games, but no crash)
