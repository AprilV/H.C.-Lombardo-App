## AI REFERENCE INDEX — AUTHORITATIVE NAVIGATION DOCUMENT

STATUS: ACTIVE  
AUDIENCE: AI ASSISTANTS ONLY  
AUTHORITY: SUBORDINATE TO AI_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md

This document exists to provide a **clear, ordered, non-ambiguous map** of all AI reference documentation.
It is written **for AI consumption**, not for human onboarding.

Failure to follow the order and rules defined here is a FAILURE.

---

## 1. MANDATORY READING ORDER (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Before performing ANY task, the AI MUST read the following documents IN ORDER:

1. **READ_THIS_FIRST.md**  
   Purpose: Mandatory orientation. Establishes expectations and STOP→ASK→WAIT behavior.

2. **AI_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md**  
   Purpose: Supreme authority. Defines non-negotiable execution rules and failure conditions.

3. **BEST_PRACTICES.md**  
   Purpose: Mandatory coding, cleanup, refactoring, testing, and environment standards.

4. **AI_VIOLATION_CHECKLIST.md**  
   Purpose: Violation identification reference. Used when behavior is questioned or corrected.

If ANY document above has not been read:
→ STOP  
→ DO NOT PROCEED  
→ ASK QUESTIONS  

---

## 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE REFERENCES

After completing mandatory documents, the AI MUST use the following files as **authoritative sources of system facts**:

5. **ARCHITECTURE.md**  
   Authority for:
   - Technology stack
   - System layout
   - Data flow
   - API endpoints
   - Database schema
   - ML models
   - Environment variables
   - Deployment constraints

Architecture facts override assumptions and code comments.

---

## 3. DOMAIN-SPECIFIC REFERENCES

These documents provide **domain rules and logic** and MUST be used when working in their scope:

6. **NFL_SPREAD_BETTING_GUIDE.md**  
   Authority for:
   - Spread betting logic
   - Sign conventions
   - Coverage calculations
   - Frontend display rules
   - Known historical bugs and fixes

7. **PREDICTION_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md**  
   Authority for:
   - ML prediction storage
   - Tracking workflow
   - Accuracy metrics
   - Model vs Vegas comparison logic

8. **LIVE_SCORE_SETUP.md**  
   Authority for:
   - Live score ingestion
   - ESPN API usage
   - Closing spread locking behavior
   - Game-day automation rules

---

## 4. OPERATIONAL REFERENCE

9. **QUICK_START_HCL.md**  
   Authority for:
   - Local development startup
   - Available pages and tabs
   - Basic troubleshooting
   - Verification steps

Operational documents do NOT override contracts or best practices.

---

## 5. DOCUMENT AUTHORITY HIERARCHY (SUMMARY)

Highest to lowest authority:

1. AI_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md  
2. BEST_PRACTICES.md  
3. ARCHITECTURE.md  
4. Domain Guides (NFL, ML, Live Scores)  
5. QUICK_START_HCL.md  

If conflicts exist:
→ Higher authority ALWAYS wins  
→ DO NOT resolve autonomously  
→ ASK QUESTIONS  

---

## 6. HOW THIS INDEX MUST BE USED

- This file is NOT optional.
- This file is NOT a summary.
- This file is NOT for skimming.

The AI MUST use this index to:
- Determine what to read
- Determine which document governs a task
- Avoid assumptions and partial understanding

---

## 7. FAILURE CONDITIONS

The AI has FAILED if it:
- Skips documents listed here
- Reads documents out of order
- Assumes knowledge without verification
- Proceeds without required references

On failure:
→ STOP  
→ ASK  
→ WAIT
