   - Indoor/outdoor splits

2. **`v_weather_impact_analysis`**
   - Scoring by temperature range
   - Scoring by wind speed
   - Pass/rush balance in bad weather

3. **`v_rest_advantage_analysis`**
   - Performance by rest days (3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10+)
   - Short rest disadvantage quantification

4. **`v_referee_tendencies`**
   - Penalty rates by referee
   - Home/away penalty differential
   - Point differential impact

### **Phase 2C: EPA Metrics**
