## üö® Blockers / Risks

1. **Historical Data Loading:** May take 2-3 minutes for full 2022-2024 dataset
   - *Mitigation:* Test with small dataset first, optimize if needed

2. **Production Migration:** Risk of breaking current working system
   - *Mitigation:* Full backup before migration, test in separate database first

3. **Documentation Debt:** 3 sprints of docs to catch up
   - *Mitigation:* Prioritize this sprint, allocate dedicated time

---

## üìû Questions for Dr. Foster

1. Is Sprint 8 the final sprint, or continuing to Sprint 9/10?
2. Any specific analytics features required for final submission?
3. Preference on documentation format (Markdown vs interactive dashboard)?
4. Timeline for final project submission?

**Status:** Ready to begin Sprint 8 tasks  
**Next Action:** Create SPRINT_5_COMPLETE.md documentation
