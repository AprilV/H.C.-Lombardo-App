# Session Resume Note - 2026-06-16 1531

## Reason
Startup lock trigger

## Current Git State Snapshot
- Branch: master
- Latest commits:
  - e9aff39f (HEAD -> master, origin/master) Dashboard: close out Sprint 13-16 archive metrics and statuses
  - dec52343 Restore PM Forge live updater/dashboard behavior
  - 50555087 Finalize NFL gold theme updates and dashboard deployment/UI fixes

## Current Local Working Set (Uncommitted)
- Working tree clean

## Verification Snapshot (Runtime)
- health: FAIL status=None error=<urlopen error [WinError 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it>
- teams_count: FAIL status=None error=<urlopen error [WinError 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it>
- hcl_teams_2025: FAIL status=None error=<urlopen error [WinError 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it>

## Non-Negotiable User Directives (Carry Forward)
1. App is primary project scope.
2. Dashboard is secondary but must stay accurate for stakeholder/professor review.
3. No trust-by-claim: include runtime proof before completion claims.
4. One objective at a time to prevent drift.

## Next Chat Start Procedure
1. Read this resume file first.
2. Confirm scope lock (app-first unless user explicitly selects dashboard work).
3. Run backend health snapshot before code changes.
4. Complete one concrete fix with proof output before moving on.
