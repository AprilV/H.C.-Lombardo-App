# Historical Data Storage & Future Features Plan

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: Sprint 5-6 In Progress - Database Schema Created  
**Timeline**: October 22 - November 5, 2025 (2 weeks)

---

## üìã SPRINT 5-6 OVERVIEW

**Goal**: Add historical game storage and team analytics to HC Lombardo betting app

**What We're Building:**
1. **Database Foundation** - PostgreSQL schema with 2 tables, 3 views, 5 indexes
2. **Team Analytics** - 47 statistical metrics per game (EPA, success rate, momentum)
3. **Projection Model** - Spread/total predictions using advanced metrics
4. **Team Detail Pages** - User selects team, stats, filters (home/away, last N games)

**What We're NOT Building (Yet):**
- Betting lines integration (no data source currently)
- Weather data (low priority)
- Injuries data (Sprint 7+)

---

## ‚úÖ SPRINT 5 COMPLETED (Week 1)

### Database Schema Created
- ‚úÖ `testbed/schema/hcl_schema.sql` - Complete SQL schema (620 lines)
- ‚úÖ `testbed/setup_test_db.py` - Database setup script with validation
- ‚úÖ `hcl.games` table - Game metadata (16 columns)
- ‚úÖ `hcl.team_game_stats` table - Performance metrics (50+ columns, 47 stats)
- ‚úÖ `v_team_season_stats` view - Season aggregates for team pages
- ‚úÖ `v_game_matchup_display` view - Week browsing with home/away pivoted
- ‚úÖ `v_game_matchup_with_proj` view - Adds spread/total projections
- ‚úÖ 5 indexes for query performance

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Testbed First**: Build in `nfl_analytics_test` database, migrate to production later
2. **Flask Not FastAPI**: Translate ChatGPT's FastAPI patterns to our Flask architecture
3. **Team-Centric Design**: Focus on team detail pages (user's vision) not just week browsing
4. **47 Metrics**: Track comprehensive stats (EPA, SR, YPP, turnovers, momentum, efficiency)
5. **Projection Baseline**: Use ChatGPT's formulas as starting point, backtest later

---

## ‚úÖ SPRINT 6 COMPLETED (Week 2)

### Data Loading
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `testbed/nflverse_data_loader.py` to write to database (not just CSV)
- ‚úÖ Added `--output database` flag with `--db-name` option
- ‚úÖ UPSERT logic to prevent duplicates (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE)
- ‚úÖ Loaded 2024 Week 7 data: 15 games, 30 team-game records
- ‚úÖ Validated with 7-step SQL validation script (all checks passed)

### API Development
- ‚úÖ Created `testbed/historical_api.py` - Flask API with 4 endpoints
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/teams` - List all 32 teams with season stats
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/teams/<abbr>` - Team season overview (offense, defense, splits)
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/teams/<abbr>/games` - Team game-by-game history
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/games?season=X&week=Y` - All games for a specific week
- ‚úÖ Tested with comprehensive test suite (`testbed/test_api_endpoints.py`)
- ‚úÖ **All 6 tests passed**: Root, teams list, team overview, team games, games by week, error handling

**Achievement**: Database operational with Week 7 data + 4 working API endpoints tested and validated

## üìä DATABASE SCHEMA DETAILS

### Table: hcl.games
Stores game metadata - one row per game

**Key Columns:**
- `game_id` (PK): Format YYYY_WW_AWAY_HOME (e.g., '2024_07_KC_SF')
- `season`, `week`, `game_type` ('REG', 'WC', 'DIV', 'CONF', 'SB')
- `home_team`, `away_team`, `home_score`, `away_score`
- `game_date`, `kickoff_time_utc` (timezone-aware)
- `stadium`, `city`, `state`

### Table: hcl.team_game_stats
Stores team performance - two rows per game (home + away)

**47 Statistical Metrics:**

**Core Efficiency:**
- `epa_per_play` - Expected Points Added (KEY betting metric)
- `epa_per_play_defense` - EPA allowed
- `success_rate` - % of plays that "succeed"
- `success_rate_defense` - Success rate allowed

**Offense:**
- Total plays, yards, yards per play
- Passing: yards, attempts, completions, TDs, INTs
- Rushing: yards, attempts, TDs
- First downs, explosive plays (20+ yards)

**Situational:**
- Third down: attempts, conversions, rate
- Fourth down: attempts, conversions, rate
- Red zone: attempts, scores, TDs, efficiency
- Time of possession

**Turnovers:**
- Turnovers lost, turnovers gained, differential

**Scoring:**
- Touchdowns, field goals, extra points, 2-pt conversions

**Momentum (Last 3 Games):**
- `epa_last_3_games` - Rolling average EPA
- `yards_per_play_last_3` - Rolling average YPP
- `ppg_last_3_games` - Rolling average points

### View: v_team_season_stats
Season-level aggregates per team (for team detail page overview)

**Provides:**
- Record (wins/losses)
- Scoring averages (PPG for/against)
- EPA averages (offense/defense)
- Efficiency metrics (3rd down, red zone)
- Turnover totals
- Home/away splits

### View: v_game_matchup_display
Matchup view with home/away stats in single row

**Provides:**
- Game metadata
- Home team season stats (up to that game)
- Away team season stats (up to that game)
- Momentum indicators (last 3 games)
- Matchup differentials (EPA diff, YPP diff, etc.)

### View: v_game_matchup_with_proj
Extends matchup view with projections

**Adds:**
- `projected_spread` - Formula: `-2.2*EPA_diff - 8.0*SR_diff - 1.2` (HFA)
- `projected_total` - Formula: `PPG_sum + 14.0*EPA_sum`
- `spread_confidence` - HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on differential
- `matchup_type` - MISMATCH/SHOOTOUT/DEFENSIVE_BATTLE/EVEN

---

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Projection Formulas (ChatGPT Baseline)

**Spread:**
```
projected_spread = -2.2 * (home_epa - away_epa) 
                   - 8.0 * (home_sr - away_sr) 
                   - 1.2  (home field advantage)
```
- Negative spread = home favored
- Example: -7.5 means home favored by 7.5 points

**Total:**
```
projected_total = (home_ppg + away_ppg) 
                  + 14.0 * (home_epa + away_epa)
```
- Predicts combined score
- Example: 48.5 means Over/Under at 48.5 points

**Note:** These are baseline formulas. We will backtest against 2022-2024 data to tune weights.

### Indexes for Performance
1. `idx_games_season_week` - Fast week queries
2. `idx_games_kickoff` - Fast "next week" logic
3. `idx_team_stats_team` - Fast team detail pages
4. `idx_team_stats_season_week` - Fast filtering
5. `idx_team_stats_game_id` - Fast joins

### UPSERT Pattern (Prevent Duplicates)
```sql
INSERT INTO hcl.games (game_id, season, week, ...)
VALUES (%s, %s, %s, ...)
ON CONFLICT (game_id) 
DO UPDATE SET 
    home_score = EXCLUDED.home_score,
    away_score = EXCLUDED.away_score,
    updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

### Database Relationships

```
teams (current snapshot)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No relationships (standalone for speed)

team_stats_weekly (historical)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Links to teams via team_abbr (not enforced FK for flexibility)

games (schedule/results)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home_team ‚Üí teams.abbreviation
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ away_team ‚Üí teams.abbreviation

betting_lines (odds/lines)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ game_id ‚Üí games.game_id (FK enforced)
```

**Why This Design:**
1. **`teams` table unchanged** - Current app keeps working
2. **Historical in separate table** - Time-series queries optimized
3. **Betting isolated** - Can show/hide, separate concerns
4. **Flexible** - Can query any time period without breaking current API

---

## üé® UI/UX DESIGN - User Access

### Current App Pages (Keep)
1. **Home Page** - Current standings (uses `teams` table)
   - URL: `http://localhost:5000/`
   - Data: `/api/teams` endpoint

2. **Dr. Foster Dashboard** - Database viewer
   - URL: `file:///.../dr.foster/index.html`
   - Data: Direct database queries

#### 5. **User Timeline Feature** (Future - Phase 3)
**Dropdown on main page**: "View stats from..."
- Today
- Yesterday
- 2 days ago
- Last week
- 2 weeks ago
- Last year (same week)
- Custom date

**Query Logic**:
```python
if selected == "2 days ago":
    # Calculate week from 2 days ago
    target_week = current_week - 1  # approximate
    query team_stats_weekly WHERE week=target_week
```

---

## üîÑ DATA FLOW

### Current Flow (Keep Running)
```
Every 15 minutes:
  multi_source_data_fetcher.py
    ‚Üì
  UPDATE teams table (current snapshot)
    ‚Üì
  API serves /api/teams
```

### NEW Flow (Add in Parallel)
```
Daily (or weekly):
  nflverse_data_fetcher.py
    ‚Üì
  INSERT INTO team_stats_weekly (historical snapshots)
  INSERT INTO games (schedule updates)

2. **Modify `live_data_updater.py`** to:
   - INSERT into history tables (not just UPDATE)
   - Keep current `teams` table for API speed
   - Archive data for historical queries
3. **Update API endpoints** to support time-based queries:
   - `/api/teams/{abbr}/history?date=2025-10-20`
   - `/api/teams/{abbr}/week/{week}`
   - `/api/games/{id}/betting_lines`
4. **Test data retention** (ensure no performance issues)

---

## üíæ STORAGE ESTIMATES

**Current**: ~32 rows in teams table  
**After Phase 2**: ~100,000 rows/year in history tables  
**After Phase 3**: ~1,000,000 rows/year in betting_lines (high frequency updates)  
**After Phase 6**: ~2,000,000 rows/year in advanced_stats_history (37 stats √ó 32 teams √ó frequent updates)

**Total**: ~3-5 million rows/year (manageable with PostgreSQL + indexes)

---

## üìã BLOCKING ISSUES

**Cannot proceed with user features until**:
1. ‚úÖ Database in place (DONE)
2. ‚úÖ APIs working (DONE)
3. ‚úÖ Data updates every 15 min (DONE)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Historical data storage** (IN PROGRESS - THIS DOCUMENT)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Betting line storage** (NEXT)
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Game schedule data** (NEXT)

---

## üéØ DECISION NEEDED

**User**: Should we start Phase 2 now?

**Phase 2 Implementation** would:
1. Create historical tables
2. Modify data updater to archive snapshots
3. Keep current API fast (still uses `teams` table)
4. Enable "2 days ago" / "last week" queries
5. Take ~1-2 hours to implement and test

**Ready to proceed?**

   - Load weekly player stats (2022-2024)
   - Aggregate player stats to team-game level
   - Calculate derived stats (yards/play, turnovers)
   - Populate all three tables
4. Add API endpoints:
   - `/api/historical/team/{abbr}` - all games for team
   - `/api/historical/team/{abbr}/season/{year}` - single season
   - `/api/betting/lines/{game_id}` - betting lines for game
   - `/api/betting/upcoming` - next week's lines
5. Build UI page: "Historical Stats & Betting Lines"

### üó∫ **PHASE 4: ADVANCED ANALYTICS** (Future - ChatGPT Schema)
*Opponent-adjusted metrics, matchup modeling, power ratings*

**Timeline**: Post-graduation / After production proven stable  
**Complexity**: HIGH - requires statistical modeling

This is where the complex ChatGPT schema comes in:
- Opponent-adjusted EPA (normalize for defensive strength)
- Matchup-specific variables (pass-heavy vs pass defense)
- Power ratings / team strength scores
- Materialized views for performance
- Predictive modeling algorithms
- Line movement analysis (requires external API)
- Sharp money indicators (requires external source)

**Save for Phase 4 - Don't overcomplicate MVP**

---

## üéØ REALISTIC MVP SCOPE FOR BACHELOR'S PROJECT

### **NOW (Phase 2 - Next 2 weeks):**
- ‚úÖ Basic team stats (points, yards, plays) per game
- ‚úÖ Betting lines (spread, total, moneyline)
- ‚úÖ Home/away context
- ‚úÖ Rest days / short week indicators
- ‚úÖ 3 seasons historical data (2022-2024)
- ‚úÖ Simple UI showing team history + betting lines

- Weather regression analysis

**Deliverable**: Professional-grade betting analytics platform

---

## üöÄ READY TO START PHASE 2?

**What we'll build:**
1. Three new tables: `team_game_stats`, `betting_lines`, `game_context`
2. Data loader: Pull 2022-2024 seasons from nflverse (~850 games)
3. API endpoints: Historical team stats + betting lines
4. Simple UI: Team history viewer with betting context

**Time estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Complexity**: Medium (aggregating player stats to team level)  
**Risk**: Low (nflverse proven working, data available)

**Shall I create the Phase 2 schema and start building the data loader?**

```
