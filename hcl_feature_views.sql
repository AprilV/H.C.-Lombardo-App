-- HCL FEATURE ENGINEERING VIEWS
-- H.C. Lombardo NFL Analytics App
-- Created: October 30, 2025
-- ============================================================================
-- 
-- These views transform raw game data into analytical insights:
-- 1. v_team_betting_performance - ATS records, O/U performance
-- 2. v_weather_impact_analysis - Scoring by weather conditions
-- 3. v_rest_advantage - Win rates by rest days
-- 4. v_referee_tendencies - Penalty patterns by official
--
-- Usage: Query these views like regular tables
-- Example: SELECT * FROM hcl.v_team_betting_performance WHERE team = 'BAL';

-- VIEW 1: Team Betting Performance
-- ============================================================================
-- Calculates each team's record against the spread (ATS) and over/under (O/U)
-- 
-- Use cases:
-- - Identify teams that consistently cover the spread
-- - Find teams that go over/under more often
-- - Analyze betting trends by season or situation
