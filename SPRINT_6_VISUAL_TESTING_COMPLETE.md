## What Was Built

### 1. Test Environment
- **Location:** `testbed/` directory (isolated from production)
- **Database:** `nfl_analytics_test` (PostgreSQL)
- **Schema:** `hcl` (Historical/Current/Live)
- **Server:** Flask test server on port 5001
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Chart.js visualizations

### 2. Database Schema (3NF Design)

**Tables:**
- `hcl.games` - NFL game records (108 games for 2025 Weeks 1-7)
- `hcl.team_game_stats` - Team performance per game (216 records, 2 per game)

**Views:**
- `hcl.v_team_season_stats` - Aggregated season statistics per team
- `hcl.v_team_game_details` - Game-level details with opponent info
- `hcl.v_team_weekly_trends` - Week-by-week performance trends

### 3. Data Pipeline

**Source:** NFLverse via `nfl-data-py` library
- Play-by-play data aggregated to team-game level
- Calculated metrics: PPG, EPA/Play, Success Rate, Yards/Play, Turnovers, etc.
- UPSERT logic to prevent duplicates
- Season filtering (currently 2025, Weeks 1-7)

**Loader:** `testbed/nflverse_data_loader.py`
- Functions: `aggregate_team_game_stats()`, `save_to_database_hcl()`
- Handles data transformation from play-by-play to team stats
- Validates data before insertion

## Known Issues & Future Enhancements

### Issue 1: Tie Handling
**Description:** Win-Loss-Tie records display ties as losses  
**Example:** Dallas Cowboys 3-3-1 displays as "3-4"  
**Impact:** Minor - Only affects display, underlying data is correct  
**Priority:** Low  
**Proposed Fix:** Add tie column to record display logic  
**Sprint:** Defer to Sprint 7 or later

### Issue 2: No OT Indicator
**Description:** Overtime games not distinguished from regulation games  
**Impact:** Minor - Missing context for game results  
**Priority:** Low  
**Proposed Fix:** Add OT flag to games table and display in game history  
**Sprint:** Defer to Sprint 7 or later

### Enhancement 1: Multi-Season Support
**Description:** Currently only 2025 data loaded  
**Scope:** Add 2023 and 2024 seasons  
**Benefit:** Historical comparisons across multiple years  
**Effort:** Medium - requires additional data loading and UI updates

### Enhancement 2: Week 8+ Data
**Description:** Only Weeks 1-7 loaded (as of Oct 22, 2025)  
**Scope:** Load remaining weeks as season progresses  
**Benefit:** Keep data current throughout season  
**Effort:** Low - rerun data loader periodically

### Enhancement 3: Playoff Data
**Description:** Current loader has issues with playoff games  
**Error:** "integer out of range" when loading full season  
**Scope:** Fix playoff week handling in data loader  
**Benefit:** Complete season coverage  
**Effort:** Medium - requires debugging playoff data structure

## Team Notes

**Development Approach:** Test-driven, isolated environment  
**Testing Method:** Systematic visual verification (7 tests)  
**Data Source:** NFLverse (reliable, well-maintained)  
**Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns (data/API/UI)

**Key Success Factors:**
- Strict testbed isolation prevented production issues
- Visual testing caught data accuracy issues early
- User-guided verification ensured real-world usability
- Backup before testing protected work
- One-question-at-a-time testing methodology was effective

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always verify data season matches requirements
- Visual testing reveals issues automated tests miss
- Tie/OT edge cases need explicit handling
- NFLverse data structure changes between regular/playoff
- User confirmation is critical for declaring features complete
- Never claim completion without visual verification

## Conclusion

Sprint 6 successfully delivered a working historical data viewing system that passed all visual tests. The test environment proves the concept is viable and the implementation is solid. The user interface is intuitive, charts display correctly, and data accuracy is validated.

**All 7 visual tests passed with 100% success rate.**

The system is ready for production integration pending data enhancements (playoff support, multi-season loading) and React component conversion.

**Sprint 6 Status: COMPLETE** ✅
